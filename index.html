	1. User will reach the home page and see a search bar.
	2. Next to the search bar will be a search tab with instructions that say,
	"Which store would you like to shop from?"
	3. Store options will include:
	-Walmart
	-Ebay
	-Target
	4. Maybe below the search bar we have a question like, "What do you feel like shopping for?"
	5. User will type something they feel like searching for and it will yield related results
	of items from the specific store that they are shopping from.
	6. When results are yielded, maybe we have the site tell the user, "Here's some things you might be
	interested in."
	7. User will then have ability to click on the items they are interested in potentially purchasing.
